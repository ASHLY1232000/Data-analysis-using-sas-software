# DATA ANALYSIS USING SAS SOFTWARE
Paired  T Test using SAS 9.4
# ABOUT THE PROJECT
Data are collected twice on the same subject(or matched subjects)the proper analysis is the paired t-test.In this case subjects may be measured in a before-after fashion,or in a design where a treatment is administered for a time,there is a washoutperiod,and another treatment is administered(in random order for each subject).Here the data describes weight of 50 0bese women before and after 12 weeks very low calorie diet (VLCD) Treatment .By analyzing the data we can identify that there is a significiant mean difference in their weight of before and after treatment.
# STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
SAS 9.4 software is used for the analysis of the data.To compare the two paired groups ,use PROC TTEST with the PAIRED statement .The purpose of the test is to determine whether there is any statistical evidence that the mean difference between the paired observations is significiantly different from zero .
# GOAL
To check there is any significiant difference in the weight of before and after VLCD Treatment
# RESULT
H0 : There is n0 significiant mean difference in before and after weight of the VLCD Treatment
H1:There is significiant mean difference in before and after weight of the VLCD Treatment
here the P Value is < 0.001 so we fail to accept the null hypothesis ,there is significiant mean difference in before and after weight of the VLCD  Treatment[paired t test using sas.docx](https://github.com/ASHLY1232000/Data-analysis-using-sas-software/files/10366633/paired.t.test.using.sas.docx)
